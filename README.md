Title: Rage Against
Genre: top-down shooter

Description:
Initially, I wanted to make a multi-leveled top-down shooter with different power ups, 2 different difficulties, and mini-custcenes.
However in response to TA feedback, I have come to realize that the scope of this game was a bit too ambitious and so I scaled it back 
dramatically.

New changes include:
Now a single-level game with the goal being to defeat the boss
boss has a "second phase" in which he gets faster and more enemies spawn
