Markup : ###Genre: top-down shooter###

Description:
Initially, I wanted to make a multi-leveled top-down shooter with different power ups, 2 different difficulties, and mini-custcenes.
However in response to TA feedback, I have come to realize that the scope of this game was a bit too ambitious and so I scaled it back 
dramatically.

New changes include:
 *Now a single-level game with the goal being to defeat the boss
 *Boss has a "second phase" in which he gets faster and other enemies start to spawn (begins at 75% health)
 *Game ends when either player dies or boss is killed.

Challenges:
Unfortunately due to time constraints, there are a number of implementations that I was unable to implement such as...

 *Being able to "parry" enemy bullets
 *Expand the play area
 *More enemy variety (as of now, there are only 2 enemy types)
 *stage hazards (the "water areas" of the map were intended to slow the player, and bushes were meant to have collision)
